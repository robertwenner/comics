=head1 NAME

Comic::Check::Series - Checks a comic's series meta information.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $check = Comic::Check::Series->new();
    foreach my $comic (@all_comics) {
        $check->check($comic);
    }
    # ...
    $check->final_check();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Comic::Check::Series keeps track of the comics it has seen and hence all
comics need to be checked by the same Comic::Check::Series.


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new Comic::Check::Series.

=cut


sub new {
    my ($class) = @ARG;
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new();
    return $self;
}


=head2 check

Checks the given comic's series meta information to catch copy and paste
errors or when a comic belongs to a series in one language but not in
another (which seems odd).

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * B<$comic> Comic to check.

                # Do not exit the loop early here to avoid a duplicated warning
                # when the check complains about the duplicated series for both
                # languages. Exiting would skip other checks for other languages,
                # like checking if there is a series tag at all above.

    return unless (defined $comic->{meta_data}->{series}{$language});
    return trim($comic->{meta_data}->{series}{$language});
}


=head2 final_check

Does a final pass through all comics seen and cross-checks them. This
detects possible typos in series names when there is only one comic in a
series.

This method must be called when all comics have been processed, or it will
lead to false positives when it sees the first (and so far only) comic in a
series, even if other comics later belong to the same series.
