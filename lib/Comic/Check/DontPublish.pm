=head1 NAME

Comic::Check::DontPublish - Checks a comic for a special marker.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $check = Comic::Check::DontPublish->new('DONT_PUBLISH');
    foreach my $comic (@all_comics) {
        $check->check($comic);
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If any of the special markers is found in any text in the comic, the comic is
flagged with a warning.

The idea is that you can leave yourself reminders in the comic for things
you want to get back to before it's published. The idea comes from software
development, where you may want to revisit areas of the code before committing
to source control; see <L:Don't commit: Avoiding distractions while coding|
https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/dont-commit-avoiding-distractions-while-coding/>.

Comic::Check::DontPublish doesn't keep state and can be used for multiple comics.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new Comic::Check::DontPublish.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * B<@markers> Don't publish marker(s). If any of these texts is found,
    the comic is flagged. Pick something that doesn't appear normally in
    your comics, e.g., "DONT_PUBLISH". The check is case-sensitive (and an
    all-caps term may be easier for humans to spot). If no marker is given,
    this check is effectively disabled.
