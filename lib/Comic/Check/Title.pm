=head1 NAME

Comic::Check::Title - Checks a comic's title to prevent duplicate titles.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $check = Comic::Check::Title->new();
    foreach my $comic (@all_comics) {
        $check->check($comic);
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Duplicate titles make it impossible to uniquely refer to a particular comic
and could lead to file name clashes when the title is used for the output
image and HTML page file names.

Comic::Check::Title keeps track of the titles it has seen, so you need to
use the same instance for checking all your comics.
