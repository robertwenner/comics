=head1 NAME

Comic::Check::Weekday - Checks a comic's published date is always on certain
weekdays.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $check = Comic::Check::Weekday->new(5);
    foreach my $comic (@all_comics) {
        $check->check($comic);
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

For regularly published comics, it may make sense to check that a comic is
scheduled for a certain weekday, e.g., every Friday.

Comic::Check::Weekday does not keeps track of comics. It's safe to be shared
but doesn't need to be shared.


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new Comic::Check::Weekday.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * B<weekday> Weekday(s) when comics are published. Pass 1 for Monday, 2
    for Tuesday, and so on. If no weekday is given, this check is
    effectively disabled.

sub new {
    my ($class, @weekday) = @ARG;
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new();

    if (@weekday) {
        @{$self->{weekday}} = @weekday;
        foreach my $weekday (@weekday) {
            ## no critic(ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers)
            croak("Bad weekday $weekday, use 1 (Mon) - 7 (Sun)") if ($weekday < 1 || $weekday > 7);
            ## use critic
        }
    }

    return $self;
}


=head2 check

Checks that the given Comic's published date is the weekday passed in the
constructor.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * B<$comic> Comic to check. Comics without a published date are
    silently ignored.

    my ($self, $comic) = @ARG;
