=head1 NAME

Comic::Check::DuplicatedTexts - Checks a comic's transcript for duplicated texts.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $check = Comic::Check::DuplicatedTexts->new();
    foreach my $comic (@all_comics) {
        $check->check($comic);
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Comic::Check::DuplicatedTexts doesn't keeps track of comics. It's safe to be shared
but doesn't need to be shared.


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new Comic::Check::DuplicatedTexts.

=cut


sub new {
    my ($class) = @ARG;
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new();
    return $self;
}


=head2 check

Checks that the given Comic has no duplicated texts, which could be copy
& paste errors and texts forgotten to translate.

Before comparing, texts are normalized: line breaks are replaced by spaces,
multiple spaces are reduced to one. However, checks are case-sensitive, so
that you can still use "Pale Ale" in German and "pale ale" in English.

If a comic defines a meta variable C<allow-duplicated>, these texts are not
flagged as duplicated. This also works for texts spanning multiple; just use
a regular space instead of a line break when configuring this.

For example:

    {
        "allow-duplicated": [
            "Pils", "multi line text"
        ]
    }


Any text that looks like a speaker introduction (i.e., ends in a colon) is
allowed do be duplicated as well, so that characters can have the same names
in different languages without having to define an C<allow-duplicated>
exception each time.

We should probably only check this for texts from the meta layer, but this
Check is layer-agnostic (i.e., too dumb for this).

Parameters:

    # space. That way we catch differences in white space, which is probably
    # a bad attempt at duplicating texts, or even sloppy typing that has
    # only been edited in one language. This also catches multi-line texts,
    # where the whole multi line text can be added as a single element in
    # allow-duplicated.
    # Does not mess with case cause that shouldn't be duplicated. For example,
    # a character may say "pale ale" in English and "Pale Ale" in German.
