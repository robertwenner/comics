    my $self = $class->SUPER::new();
    return $self;
}


=head2 check

Checks that the given Comic's transcript always has a speaker indicator
before regular text. This helps to generate a transcript where the meta
layer has an indicator of what's happening and who says something, and the
real language layer has the text that the actors actually say. A speaker
indicator is a text that ends with a colon.

Texts are ordered for comparison per frames row from top to bottom and from
left to right.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * B<$comic> Comic to check.
