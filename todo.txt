- cleanup hard-coded names, e.g., "Rahmen" or even "Meta", "generated"

- rework variables available for templates: standardize names, pick decent
  names, DRY up them up, generate them in one place, document them

- should the names in the JSON configuration file be case-insensitive? Could
  be confusing when case actually matters, e.g., for Perl modules.
  If case matters, make sure it's used consistently. Language names are
  still used inconsistently.

- cleanup: move more vars variables into the comics, for better scoping and
  to allow multiple generators to contribute

- refact: Perl: use feature qw(signatures); no warnings
  qw(experimental::signatures); or Function::Parameters, Method::Signatures

- defect: twitter with @someone does not get tweeted for some reason

- feature: list comics (svg files) under series headings (hideable?) in
  backlog, to see which comics are in a series; extend to tags and who

- feature: don't post to reddit / don't tweet a link, if the link is dead
  (slow web server?), or have uploading code try to make sure the upload
  worked (link check)

- feature: define comic order by refering the previous or next comic,
  instead of having a date, so that inserting one for current events doesn't
  ripple through the backlog (and still maintaining a regular / weekly
  schedule); or provide a script that inserts a comic by moving all others
  (complicated, needs to know on which dates comics are published, and would
  still mess up comics that need to stay in place for e.g., holidays)

- feature: internal archive with published dates and (source svg) file names
  and comic counts (maybe a matter of the template only); backlog only shows
  unpublished ones

- feature: allow adding (invisible) watermarks

- feature: transcript needs to check all frames for ordering, not just rows;
  that should get rid of space padding in texts

- feature: handle more frame varieties, e.g., long frame over 2 rows on the
  side

- feature: email current comic when publishing; email list management should
  not be part of this

- feature: add "previously published in ..." link to the bottom of the page
  for comics that didn't appear on the web page initially

- feature: support a comics by series pages / links (can a comic be in more
  than one series? (why not?))

- feature: prev next first last buttons per series

- feature: tags under each comics, as hyperlinks to the tag cloud
  (see https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-idioms.html#tag-clouds) or comics
  by tag pages

- feature: export svg instead of png (for a truly fluent / responsive web
  design), but would also need to offer the font for download, I guess? or
  chop the svgs or pngs up per frame (ugly, relies on either table-based
  HTML layout, CSS magic beyond my skills, or chopping comics by rows only)

- feature: minimize svg file sizes (e.g., with svgo), if svg export is supported

- feature: generate latex code for pdf, or generarte pdf right away

- feature: liner notes with comments in pdf, suck in other interesting
  documentation. This can pull stats per comics from git: how long between
  creation and publication, how long was the backlog each Fri, how big was
  the ideas file each week, how often was the comic changed (after being
  published).

- feature: sizemap should have colors depending on where the comic was
  published, not published vs unpublished

- feature: make more sizemap svg attributes configurable

- feature: add a thumbnail / preview for really large images (posters),
  especially in RSS

- check for date holes (why? are those bad? only in the future? but I could
  schedule a xmas or Fri 13 comic ahead of time and then have holes and
  that's ok); warn in backlog if no comic for next Friday

- feature: more social media: Mastodon, Openbook, Ello, Diaspora, inrupt.com
  (via Zapier?)

- feature: use inkscape shell to export in bulk (could be faster than
  creating multiple inkscape processes), would be great to avoid writing
  temp svg files if inkscape accepts the svg on stdin

- publish on CPAN, add badge to README.md like this for Minilla:
  [![MetaCPAN Release](https://badge.fury.io/pl/Minilla.svg)](https://metacpan.org/release/Minilla)
  https://badge.fury.io/for/pl

- feature: check that published date is >= created date (typo?)

- performance: profile and fix slooooow handling of some (large?) svg files;
  debug hiccups when it seems to stall for minutes (when cache is stale, but
  looks like frame collection could be the problem, not actually calling
  inkscape)

- feature: check that speaker names all show up in the "who" meta data (but
  be careful about additional text, like "Paul, opening a beer:")

- performance: write qr code file only when writing the pngs, i.e., when the
  source has changed (only need this if the generated title / qr code file
  name has changed, but this is harder to detect)

- performance: speed up with multiple threads for checking and converting
  svg files (1 thread per comic, then wait till all are done; reuse threads
  for writing per-comic pages, when all next/prev links are known)

- performance: cache more data, like png sizes, transcript, and frame
  positions? use a database / key-value store?

- feature: verbose and debug flags to print what's going on (helpful for
  configurable checks and actions)

- refact: switch Twitter module to Twitter::API

- feature: check 2FA for Reddit and Twitter

- performance: when modifying only the latest comic (or an unpublished
  comic), don't recreate all html pages (only if the latest comic file name
  (title) changes, links need to get updated). This should speed up final
  touches on the latest comic

- defect: frame detection for text outside of a single frame (comic title)
  does not seem to treat that text as after anything within the frame. The
  whole frame handling code needs a close look.

- defect: frame detection lumps text under the last row of frames in that
  last row, breaking captions under comics

- feature: should frame detection at the top of the comic use frames of the
  next (first) row? that would allow having a title above the frame, like
  "yesterday" and "today".

- defect: does it treat text outside of a meta layer as speaker label just
  because it ends in a colon (motivation.svg)? it probably should not.

- check if meta text is not in a meta layer? by checking for colons? but
  trailig colons should be ok.

- feature (defect?): transcript check needs to not just grab all texts in
  order but also respect layers: don't treat regular text as speaker
  indicator just because it ends in a colon (could be a before / after style
  comic).

- feature: upload to e.g., imgur.com and then post a link to that on reddit.
  This may be interesting for people not running their own website, and for
  subreddits that only accept file hosting on certain sites (like imgur).

- feature: a rss / atom feed module that doesn't require the user to provide
  a template and hence know the feed format.

- feature: allow comics to opt out of the feed. (use case?)

- feature: post "classics" to social media if there is no new comic

- feature: complain about unknown settings to catch typos (done for Generators,
  missing in Checks)

- clean out backlog: when a comic goes from backlog to published, remove its
  html file from the backlog

- feature: check text positions as double, so that you can move texts
  minimally to control the transcript without visual impact

- performance: does it make a difference to remove unneeded top level layers
  (other languages, turned invisible in Inkscape) instead of switching them
  to hidden? Files would be smaller (is disk space an issue anyway?), but
  would converting them be faster?

- feature: make tags configurable instead of using hard-coded "who",
  "series", and "tags"; for backlog as well as various comics-by-x overviews

- replace vars{'tags'} and vars{'tagsOrder'} in backlog with an ordered hash
  if Template supports this nicely

- feature: backlog currently appends language name to tags and series, it
  could instead return hashes with languages as keys. On the one hand the
  template gets more complicated (one more nested loop), on the other hand
  it's cleaner and would allow to show / hide tags or series per language

- refact: break up Comic::Out::Backlog into the actual backlog part and meta
  data (e.g., tags) aggregation overview

- feature: support aggregating meta data that's not per-language in the
  backlog (author, contrib, published when / where)

- feature: sitemap should work without people having to define a template

- feature: if we keep the sitemap via template, filter the list passed to
  each template instead of passing the filter notFor function for easier use

- feature: default subreddits should be per language hash, both in config
  and in comic meta data (support meta data single value for backward
  compatibility)

- feature: make configurable prefix / suffix for Reddit titles

- feature: Comic::Social::Twitter needs a svg mode

- performance: write everything needed to publish to a cache file
  (database?) so that publishing code doesnÂ´t need to scan all comics again
  (may be tricky with generating pages for archive, tags, etc)

- feature: see meta data should try to resolve path relative to current
  comic

- feature: allow copying static files and pipe them through a Template to
  modify bits in mostly static files, like a copyright year in an index.html

- defect: copyright placement is way off if frames x is not around -206?

- feature: deduct output path from fragments, like outdir / base dir plus
  language placeholders, for less repetitive configuration files

- feature: spellcheck containers inside other containers first, to provide a
  more accurate location of misspelled words (English vs ContainerEnglish)

- feature: spellcheck: specify a comics specific word list, allow ignoring
  #hashtags, allow ignoring words with non-letters, ignoring case, passing
  hypenated German words as one word.

- feature: warnings as errors

- feature: allow manually ordering frames by naming them (ids) with numbers
  to tell the transcript collector in which order to process frames (and
  with that texts), may be needed for panels that cover multiple rows

- feature: allow manually ordering texts by naming them (ids) with numbers
  to force transcript order in more elaborate cartoons (often single panel)

- feature: warn about spellcheck ignore words defined in the comic but not
  used

- feature: specify qr code image size (e.g., in pixels)

- defect: png meta info needs to turn newlines into spaces, not just remove
  them completely

- feature: support https://www.indexnow.org/

- feature: allow picking up Dublin core entities from Inkscape's document
  properties: Creator = Author and Artist, Rights = Copyright; use for PNG
  meta data and make available in templates

- feature: pick up Contributors from Inkscape document properties, make
  available in templates (merge with current contributors JSON meta data)

- feature: use relative links for HtmlLink for easy offline use

- doc: more dev documentation: how to add a new check, output generator, or
  social media poster; how Comic as a value object ties everything together,
  the role of Comics as a simple entry point

- doc: add example comic project with comics, templates, cron script,
  settings.json
